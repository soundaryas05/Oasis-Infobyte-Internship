# Data Cleaning Project - Oasis Infobyte Internship

## Description

Data cleaning is the process of fixing, removing, or correcting incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. Inaccurate or messy data can lead to unreliable analysis and flawed outcomes. A crucial part of the data analysis workflow, data cleaning helps ensure the integrity and consistency of your dataset, making it suitable for accurate insights. In this project, I demonstrate essential data cleaning techniques, which are fundamental to any data analysis pipeline.

This project is part of my **Oasis Infobyte Internship**, where I am learning and applying various data cleaning techniques using real-world datasets. The goal is to clean and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring it is consistent, reliable, and free of errors.

The project covers various aspects of data cleaning, including handling missing data, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and identifying outliers. Clean data is essential for any subsequent analysis or machine learning model, and this project will help you develop a strong foundation in data cleaning.

## Key Concepts and Challenges

### 1. Data Integrity
Ensuring that the data remains accurate, consistent, and reliable throughout the cleaning process is paramount. This includes checking for inconsistencies, errors, and validating that the data reflects the real-world situation it represents.

### 2. Missing Data Handling
Missing values are a common issue in many datasets. In this project, we tackle missing data by:
- Identifying missing values.

- - Deciding on the best approach to handle them: whether imputing (filling) the values with meaningful data or removing the rows/columns.

### 3. Duplicate Removal
Duplicate records can distort analysis by giving undue weight to some data points. We identify and eliminate duplicate rows to ensure the uniqueness of the data.

### 4. Standardization
Standardizing data ensures that it follows consistent formatting and units across the entire dataset. This is crucial for accurate analysis, as inconsistent data types or units can lead to misleading results.

### 5. Outlier Detection
Outliers can significantly affect the results of your analysis or predictive models. We use techniques like Z-scores to detect and handle outliers, either by removing them or adjusting their values to avoid skewing the analysis.
