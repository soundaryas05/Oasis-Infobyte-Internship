    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **Retail Sales dataset**. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business optimize its operations and make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The project utilizes two datasets that contain information about retail sales, customer demographics, and product details. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset 1**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=retail+sales\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts and Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: \n",
    "   - Import and load the retail sales dataset.\n",
    "   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting columns.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Descriptive Statistics**: \n",
    "   - Calculate key statistics such as **mean**, **median**, **mode**, **standard deviation** to understand the data better.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Time Series Analysis**: \n",
    "   - Explore sales trends over time using techniques like resampling and rolling averages.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Customer and Product Analysis**: \n",
    "   - Investigate customer demographics and purchasing behavior, including **age group** and **gender** analysis.\n",
    "   - Analyze **Product Category** and total sales to understand product performance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Data Visualization**: \n",
    "   - Visualize insights using various plots (e.g., **bar charts**, **line plots**, **heatmaps**, etc.) to convey findings effectively.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Recommendations**: \n",
    "   - Provide actionable recommendations to the retail business based on the findings from the EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gain hands-on experience in **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.\n",
    "- Learn how to calculate and interpret **descriptive statistics** and how to perform **time series analysis**.\n",
    "- Develop skills in using **data visualization tools** such as **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly** for communicating insights.\n",
    "- Improve your ability to make **data-driven recommendations** for business decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Involved\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Load the data.\n",
    "   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and format columns correctly.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Univariate Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Explore the distribution of important features like **Total Amount** and **Product Category**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Bivariate Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Investigate relationships between different features like **Product Category vs. Total Amount**, **Quantity vs. Price per Unit**, etc.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Multivariate Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Perform analysis across multiple features (e.g., **Date, Total Amount, and Quantity**) to uncover monthly sales trends and patterns.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Visualizations**:\n",
    "   - Create various plots to visualize the insights and trends identified during the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the following tools and libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python**: The primary programming language for analysis.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.\n",
    "- **Plotly**: For interactive charts (if used in the project).\n",
    "- **Numpy**: For numerical operations and handling missing values.\n",
    "- **Scipy**: For statistical analysis.\n",
